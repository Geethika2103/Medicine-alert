# Medicine-alert

Electron Elite, successfully completed the project "Medicine Alert using Arduino" at Circuithon, held under CIRCUITNOVA by IEEE IES SBC NSSCE !

Working alongside my teammates Bharath B Chandran & Akshara S Pasad , we developed a Medicine Alert System designed to help elderly individuals, especially those living alone, remember to take their medication on time. The system is built using Arduino UNO and RTC DS3231, ensuring precise time tracking. 

This project was an incredible learning experience, allowing us to apply our embedded systems and circuit design knowledge while addressing a real-world issue.
